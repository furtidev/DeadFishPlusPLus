# :wave: Welcome to DeadFish++

**DeadFish++** is a custom [Deadfish](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Deadfish#Python_3.x) interpreter written in Python. <br> If you're wondering, Deadfish is a joke language.


# :question: Why is it called "Deadfish"?
[:paperclip: Taken from here](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Deadfish#Why_.22deadfish.22.3F)
:tropical_fish: Deadfish was originally going to be called *fishheads* as programming in this language is like eating raw fish heads. **However, due to the limiting features of the language, programming in this language became like eating (and having to smell) dead, rotting fish heads, an experience not often generally considered pleasurable.**

## :pushpin: Commands

DeadFish++ contains all the basic Deadfish [commands](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Deadfish#Commands). But has a couple of it's own commands as well.
|command| description | Only DeadFish++
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| i | increments the accumulator | `No`
| d | decrements the accumulator | `No`
| s | squares the accumulator | `No`
| o | outputs the accumulator | `No`
| c | compiles the deadfish code <br> to ASCII string | `Yes`
| r | resets the accumulator | `Yes`
